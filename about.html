      <h1>About Me</h1>
      <p>
        Hi, I’m Joseph Olaniyi, a passionate Frontend Developer with a love for
        building sleek, functional, and user-friendly web experiences. I
        specialize in creating responsive websites using React, Tailwind CSS,
        JavaScript, and modern frontend tools.
      </p>
      <p>
        I enjoy solving real-world problems through design and code turning
        ideas into digital products that look great and perform even better.
        Whether it’s a startup landing page, an ecommerce platform, or a
        personal project, I approach every build with clean code, attention to
        detail, and a drive to learn something new.
      </p>
      <p>
        When I’m not coding, you’ll probably find me exploring tech trends,
        analyzing UI designs, or brainstorming new business ideas in the digital
        space. I believe great web experiences aren’t just built they’re crafted
        with intent, precision, and creativity.
      </p>
